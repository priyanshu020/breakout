# Breakout

The aim of the game is simple, you have to destroy all the blocks using the ball. The difficult part is lining yourself up so you don't miss it.

You can move your paddle back and forth to break the bricks and each time you break a brick it disappears and the score increases.
And if you miss the ball, your score resets and the brick reappears.

Also, the project is built using the [Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API). The Canvas API largely focuses on 2D graphics.
